## About Zenbase AI

Zenbase AI is transforming how developers ship with AI. Our flagship product, Zenbase Core, is a library for programming — not prompting — AI in production. It's a spin-out of [Stanford NLP's DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) project, initiated by key contributors. While DSPy excels as a framework for R&D, Zenbase aims to be its counterpart for software engineering. We enable developers to create better user experiences faster by focusing on programming rather than prompting.

## Our Mission

We aim to revolutionize AI prompt engineering and optimize AI workflows across various industries, empowering developers and companies to enhance their AI capabilities efficiently.

## Founders

- Cyrus Nouroozi
- Amir Mehr

Both are key contributors to StanfordNLP's DSPy project and have extensive experience in AI and consulting.
